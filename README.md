# Market-Segmentation-for-E.V-Startup-project
Project done under Feynn Labs Internship
Segmentation analysis is an important step 
before we embark on a marketing plan. Hence it is 
important to learn how to analyse our audience and market. 
By analysing the market we understand that cities like bangalore and mumbai are the main parts where we can setup the companies of EV.
With that I have successfully completed my internship as 
a Machine learning intern at Feynn labs. I would like to
thank Mr.Sanjay Basumatary for this amazing opportunity.
